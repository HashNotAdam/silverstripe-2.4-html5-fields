# SilverStripe HTML5 forms

HTML fields for Silverstripe 2.4 that extend the default field types

## Requirements

* SilverStripe 2.4 (never tested in other versions)
* PHP 5.3+

## Installation

Best way is to clone this as a submodule into your SilverStripe root directory

    git submodule add [git hub url] [silverstripe directory]/html5-fields

Alternatively, you can simply copy the module into your SilverStripe root directory.

With both options, you will want to flush your cache
